Let's solve this step by step:
1. First, calculate how many marbles Janet has (3 times Tom's)
</reasoning>
<tool>
{
    "name": "calculate",
    "args": {"expression": "3 * 12"}
}
</tool>
<result>36</result>

<reasoning>
2. Now we know:
   - Tom has 12 marbles
   - Janet has 36 marbles
   Let's add them together
</reasoning>
<tool>
{
    "name": "calculate",
    "args": {"expression": "36 + 12"}
}
</tool>
<result>48</result>

<reasoning>
Together they have 48 marbles:
- Tom: 12 marbles
- Janet: 36 marbles (3 times Tom's)
- Total: 48 marbles
</reasoning>
<answer>48 marbles</answer>'''

Let's solve this step by step:
1. Calculate the selling price with 40% markup
</reasoning>
<tool>
{
    "name": "calculate",
    "args": {"expression": "50 * 1.4"}
}
</tool>
<result>70.0</result>

<reasoning>
The selling price is $70 per pair.
Now let's calculate the profit on 3 pairs:
Profit = (Selling price - Cost) * Number of pairs
</reasoning>
<tool>
{
    "name": "calculate",
    "args": {"expression": "(70 - 50) * 3"}
}
</tool>
<result>60.0</result>

<reasoning>
The store makes:
- $20 profit per pair ($70 - $50)
- On 3 pairs, total profit is $60
